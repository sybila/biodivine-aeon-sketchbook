A set of benchmarks based on partially specified variants of real models, with synthetic attractor data.
The data was sampled from the attractors of the original model.

Expected results (numbers of candidates after evaluating static/dynamic properties):
| Model    | After static | After dynamic |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| cell_div_b  | 64000 | 14088 |
| eprotein | 1179648 | 128 |
| etc | 242337096 | 3167262 |
| interferon | 53378248050663950000000 | 682290 |
| macrophage | 9973140848784  | 787353224904 |
| nsp4 | 1179648 | 128 |
